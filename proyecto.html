In a country of long winters, the ice is not an obstacle, but a playground that forges discipline and unity. It is lived as a daily ritual, from matches on frozen lakes to the professional fervor of the Liiga, connecting all generations. Its importance lies in being the greatest symbol of national pride, capable of uniting the entire country in massive celebrations and demonstrating that a small nation can hold its own against world powers.</td>

Its main difference from baseball is the vertical pitch, a technique that eliminates downtime and transforms it into an extremely fast-paced, strategy-based &quot;physical chess.&quot; Taught in all schools and prioritizing intelligence over strength, it has become a unique symbol of identity that unites Finland's rural and urban communities.</td>
