      <td height="28">1. Karjalanpiirakka<br>
      This is probably one of the most representative dishes of Finland. Karelian cakes, or karjalanpiirakka in Finnish, are snacks. The dough that wraps this cake is commonly rye and is filled with rice. This rice is made with milk and salt. Other well-known fillings for this cake are talkkuna and barley. Butter is put on top of this cake and the most delicious mixture to accompany it has munavoi, a kind of boiled eggs. They are rarely seen anymore, but if you find a Karelian cake with a thick rye crust, do not hesitate to try it, as they are one of the most traditional. <br></td>
      <td><p>2. Lihapullat<br>
        Lihapullat are basically minced meat dumplings, but they have the special thing about being prepared in the Finnish style. Meatballs have several ingredients that make them special and delicious. You can feel in the lihapullat pieces of bread that are wet with milk before being prepared.<br>

      <td>3. Pulla<br>
      We finish this selection of typical Finnish food with another sweet bread from this country, the Finnish pulla. In addition to cinnamon, pulla contains cardamom, which is its distinctive flavor. We can also mention the brown sugar, which is essential for giving it that sweet touch. The preparation ends with a spongy texture that makes it irresistible to the palate. Finnish pulla is a perfect treat for harsh winters.<br></td>

      <td><p>4. Hernekeitto<br>
        This soup is very well known in the cuisine of several European countries: the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, and, of course, Finland. The soup is even made quite a bit in Australia. In all cases, it is a pea soup where the main ingredient is mashed into a puree. This dish is usually served at home or in schools; it is truly a part of the Finnish diet.</p>
      <p></p></td>
      <td><p>5. Graavilohi<br>
        Among the typical Finnish cured foods, we find graavilohi, which is basically cured fish. This dish is also called gravlax, gravad lax, and graavadlax. Generally, the fish is washed, the fillets are removed with the skin, all the bones are taken out, and the meat is mixed with salt, sugar, and pepper. All these ingredients are rubbed onto the fish. There is one more spice that cannot be forgotten, as it gives the special Finnish touch: chopped dried dill.</p>
      <p></p></td>
      <td><p>6. Korvapuusti<br>
        Typical food of Finland? We can't stop talking about korvapuusti, delicious Finnish rolls. They are Swedish-style cinnamon rolls lightly sprinkled with sugar. The preparation starts with a rolled-out yeast dough, covered with butter and rolled up. After that, it is sprinkled not only with sugar but also with cinnamon. Korvapuusti can be enjoyed with a cup of coffee.</p>

      <td height="21"><p>7. Ruisleipa<br>
        We have talked about many main dishes of typical Finnish food, but we cannot stop talking about their bread, which is known as ruisleipa. Why talk about Finnish bread? Well, almost all the dishes in this country are served with bread, and not just any type, but the bread from the region (ruisleipa). There are two main types of bread in Finland: rye and wheat. However, you can also find bread made from wheat, oats, and potatoes.</p>

      <td>8. Poronkäristys<br>
      Poronkäristys is one of the many traditional Finnish dishes made with reindeer meat. The truth is that its preparation ingredients are very simple. Apart from this type of meat, it only includes butter, salt, pepper, water, and onion. The meat is simply placed over butter and onion to bake over medium heat. In recent decades, ingredients like garlic or peppers have been added to the recipe. What poronkäristys often does include is a bit of beer.<br></td>
      <td>9. Leipajuusto<br>
      Are you still wondering about typical Finnish food? We can’t stop telling you about leipäjuusto, a delicious cheese bread from northern Finland. It’s a fresh cheese made from cow’s colostrum, the milk the cow produces right after giving birth. If it’s very traditional and artisan, leipäjuusto is made with goat’s milk and even reindeer milk, which have a slightly different color. The curdled milk is placed in a mold that forms a round disc several centimeters thick. Leipäjuusto is traditionally baked, although it can also be grilled or flambéed. In all its preparations, it’s delicious!<br></td>
